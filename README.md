# Basic Portfolio

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll build a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS. These instructions include a short style guide; follow it to design an aesthetically pleasing layout while creating different kinds of complex HTML elements. 

### Before You Begin

* Welcome to your first opportunity as a front-end web designer. You will be advocating for your most important client—yourself! By making a portfolio, you'll take your first step toward building your web development brand.

* This will be one of your harder assignments, if only because you're just getting your feet wet in web design. Trust us, though; it will get easier. Invest your time in this assignment, and it will pay dividends! 

### Instructions

1. Create a new repository in GitHub called `Basic-Portfolio`.

2. Clone this repository to your computer using the process we went over in class.

3. Navigate to the `Basic-Portfolio` folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder, create the following:

   * 3 HTML documents: `index.html`, `contact.html` and `portfolio.html`.
   * A folder called `assets`.
   * Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: `css` and `images`.
     * In the `css` folder, make a file called `style.css`.
     * In the `css` folder, make a file called `reset.css`, and include the code found from the Meyerweb reset located [here](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css).
     * In the `images` folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image, the placeholder images for the portfolio, and the social icon images).

4. Push the above changes to GitHub. https://seirradawson.github.io/basic-portfolio/
